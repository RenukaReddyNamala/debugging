The bug in the code is the incorrect use of the && operator inside the loop. The && operator is used for element-wise comparison, but in this context, it's treating the entire column of outliers[,j] as a single logical value, resulting in unexpected behavior. To fix this, we should replace && with &, which is the element-wise logical AND operator.

Here's the corrected code:
  tukey_multiple <- function(x) {
   outliers <- array(TRUE,dim=dim(x))
   for (j in 1:ncol(x)) {
      outliers[,j] <- outliers[,j] & tukey.outlier(x[,j])
   }
   outlier.vec <- vector(length=nrow(x))
   for (i in 1:nrow(x)) { 
      outlier.vec[i] <- all(outliers[i,]) 
   } 
   return(outlier.vec) 
}
